# KianKit

KianKit is a powerful starter kit that combines the flexibility of SvelteKit with the robustness of Supabase, enabling you to build robust and feature-rich applications over the weekend.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
3. Configure the Supabase environment variables in the `.env` file with your Supabase project credentials.

> **Note:** KianKit is preconfigured for deployment on Vercel. However, you can easily change the deployment target by modifying the adapter in the `svelte.config.js` file.
